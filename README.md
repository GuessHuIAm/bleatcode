## About Bleat
Each user has an ID linked to a problem set that will keep track of problem-solving progression.
Choose a problem from a problem set and read what it's about (description, examples, etc.).
Edit a code solution file using nano and then submitting it for testing with a few test cases.
Invoke a sample solution panel.
